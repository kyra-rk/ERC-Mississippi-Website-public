{/* General Comments: 
  - Why don't we use HomepageStats?
  - Feature page format/styling inconsistent with others.
  - Image is not centered within it's col? When shortening page width it is left justified.
  - Statistics large numbers overlap when shortening page width.
  - Features description (introdution class I think) has too much padding.
  - Features "col-md-4" class is organized well but too much padding on the side (even on website mode).
  - Features icons are too small when shortening page width. 
  - Features writing overflows it's given box. 
    ↪ Look at the "text-muted" class. It is far bigger. Try bind width? 
  - Scroll demos are OK but too much margin on right and left.
  Q: What is the difference between margin and padding?
  - Maybe consider putting scroll demo video and description side by side initially
    ↪ and adjust when window size is small? OR alternatively, to make life easy 
    ↪ just put the one after the other vertically. 
  - Missing Index and Stories videos.

                  The Mississippi Women's Count aims to strengthen Mississippi
                  women's economic security by using data to better inform
                  policy makers. Our site uses both qualitative and quantitative
                  data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the unique
                  challenges women encounter. We used this data to develop a
                  women's economic security index that will inform our own
                  policy initiatives. The information was gathered from a
                  variety of sources, such as American Community Survey from the
                  US Census Bureau and interviews with Women in Construction.
                  This project is a collaboration between Mississippi Low-Income
                  Childcare Initiative and Barnard College's Empirical Reasoning
