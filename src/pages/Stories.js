      Participants from the <strong>Women in Construction Program</strong> (WinC) were interviewed about their experiences as women and mothers training to work in the 
      construction industry. By showcasing their narratives, we hope to deepen people's understanding on women's economic security in Mississippi as well as bring
      a more qualitative aspect to the economic security index.
