Later, she lived in a shelter for women, where she found herself to be a mother figure to the other women living in the shelter. As someone who loves learning, Claudine enjoys getting hands-on with the construction training at WinC, and even hired a math teacher to improve at measurements. When Claudine graduates, she is looking forward to working at Ingalls Construction, where she has already secured a job at.
