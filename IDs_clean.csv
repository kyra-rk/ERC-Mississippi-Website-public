1,1,,I just went on searching for work.,2,2.3,,,
1,1,,"As a matter of fact, I quit college at 19 and I got pregnant at 20.",7,7.1,,,
1,1,,"So, after I gave birth to my son then, you know, I started searching for jobs and stuff so I just went on from there. And then I wind up coming to the states and that was part of the government program at the time. And then I jumped ship and go private and here I am.","2,3","2.3,3.3",,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Here we are. Do you think it'll be easy or difficult for your children to get a college degree, if that's what they want. And if you think it'll be difficult or easy, why or why not?

1,1,Claudene,"With my vision of where I am at now, it's not going to be hard because I'm going to make sure that he gets it. But before Women in Construction, I didn't see it coming. I didn't know how it would have happened.",4,4.1,,,
1,1,,"I wouldn't see..I would say he would have to get out of school or maybe work while he was in school when he gets to that age, maybe 15 and try to save some money and you know maybe with me maybe I could open a college fund for him or whatever. But, before now no I didn't see a possibility.",4,4.2,,,
1,1,Interviewer,Could you tell me a little bit about the quality of public schools in your area. Is he in public school? ,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,Yes.,0,0,,,
1,1,,"He's actually going to Singing River Academy. And, academic wise. They are superb.",4,4.2,,,
1,1,Interviewer,Really?,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Cause he actually came from Jamaica with a 46 percent in overall academic and now he's at 83. And he came up in December starting school in January. So they did everything. We actually had a teacher parent conference all 5 of his teachers were there and they actually talked to me at a point where he was low on everything but you know to leave from grade 5 to 6, you have to have an 85 degree percentage average. And he's at 83 now because they print out papers to let me give to the aftercare teacher to help him. They plan to help him whenever they can and everybody punched in and stuff so you know I'm so grateful to them. If it wasn't for them I don't know what would have happened because for me what they're teaching now.",4,4.2,,,
1,1,Interviewer,I don't have either. I tried to tutor my cousin the other day in math and I was like I have no idea what this is. I just don't know what that is. So your son is enrolled in after school programs? ,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Yes, the WinC pays for it.",4,4.3,,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Oh, okay.",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,Yes.,0,0,,,
1,1,,"But their funds are stuff so they pay for him for after school and on holidays or when school– ‘cause say for tomorrow, tomorrow is Friday, school don't keep tomorrow. It's out. But they pay for the entire day.",4,4.3,,,
1,1,Interviewer,Oh wow.,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"So every day from Monday to Friday they pay for the entire day, if school is out. And then if school is in session, then they pay for after school. So now they've given me an opportunity because this allows them to lapse in December.",4,"4.3,4.4",,,
1,1,,"So even when I leave here then I can hold go job search I can get a job, actually go to work, come home, and my baby is okay.","2,4","2.3,4.4",,,
1,1,,"I don't have to worry about that extra money that I may not have at the moment or try to drain my pocket or whatever. You know so. I'm super, super, super, super, appreciative for what they do and they have no idea.","4,8","4.3,8.4",,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Okay. And how many people, so in terms of– you talked about your son, would it be difficult for you to leave work or for your son to find time to go to programs or whatever if there weren't some assistance? How many people in your household, it's just you and your son, are working and earning an income? So, it's just you right?",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,Just me.,1,1.4,,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Is this your primary source of income, Women in Construction?",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"At the moment, yes.",2,2.1,,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Great. Can you, if you feel comfortable of course, tell me what your typical monthly expenses are? So if you could estimate how much of your income you spend on like transportation or child care, housing, medical bills, or savings, or other expenses.",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Well savings, out of it. For child care, say if I was supposed to pay for child care for the year, it would be like $4,000-something.",4,4.3,,,
1,1,Interviewer,Really?,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Little me. Where would I get it from? So that's what I'm saying because I just learned about that like a week ago you know. So when I learned of that I'm like I told these people that I'm grateful. But I need to really tell them how grateful I am because I did not have a clue and learning that it's like just open my eyes, like wow.",8,8.3,,,
1,1,,You know so.,0,0,,,
1,1,,"Feeding expenses like $400 a month. A 10 year old eating snacks in between meals and take to school and all kind of stuff, you know.",0,0,,,
1,1,,"For transportation, I'll spend maybe $55-60 a week in gas.",6,6.3,,,
1,1,,"But overall like maybe if I want to buy him some new clothes or whatever it is, I couldn't afford to do that because he hasn't gotten nothing for a while. So I'm just waiting on the tax return to try to give him a blow-out and let him feel like he belongs or something. Not try to spoil it with no material things.",8,8.2,,,
1,1,,"‘Cause he's not used to it and he understands because sometimes he be like, “Mom, I'm okay.” You know sometimes it's so hard, I even cried the other day when he said that. I'm like “you're just 10 what do you know about understanding what I'm saying to you,” like that to tell me that it’s okay",3,,,,
1,1,,"You know because a lot of people ask me, especially my family, why am I in Mississippi? But they don't understand. Mississippi is, I felt closer to home because the people here, well mainly the ones I get to interact with on a daily basis, they kind of– they are loving. They're only, you know– they have a lot of hospitality in them.",1,1.3,,,
1,1,,"Even though we don't make much, and stuff, and we live in below poverty level but at the same time you can go home when you feel like your child will be comfortable if you just give them just a chip and a juice.",3,3.6,,,
1,1,,"You know they don't kind of yearn after all that thing because say for instance in New York, you know what that's like. If your child don't have on the latest brand or whatever maybe he get mocked. They still do it here but a little bit less than, you know so. You know, I'm comfy.",3,3.6,,,
1,1,,"You know because a lot of people ask me, especially my family, why am I in Mississippi? But they don't understand. Mississippi is, I felt closer to home because the people here, well mainly the ones I get to interact with on a daily basis, they kind of– they are loving. They're only, you know– they have a lot of hospitality in them.",0,0,1,,
1,1,Interviewer,Do you have any– are there any times you have difficulty paying your monthly expenses?,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,That will be more times than I do now. ‘Cause I've been to– days or weeks when I couldn't be able to do nothing.,5,5.4,,,
1,1,,"I would have to maybe call a friend or stuff to, maybe take me from point A to B because maybe I couldn't buy gas or maybe I didn't have a car or just something.",6,6.1,,,
1,1,,But it's just so bad.,0,0,,,
1,1,,I actually walked off a job one day.,0,0,,,
1,1,Interviewer,Really?,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Yes, because I was just so over it because I couldn't pay light.",0,0,,,
1,1,,"I couldn't do– I couldn't pay nothing because at the end of the month because I've been sent home so much, not just me but a lot of us. Saying that it's slow or whatever.",1,1.4,,,
1,1,,We were paid minimum wage. That was 7.25.,2,2.2,,"Minimum wage in Mississippi was last raised in 2009 by federal mandate. Assuming a person works full time for minimum wage, which is likely not the case for many, the maximum amount of income an individual can earn is $15,080. ",
1,1,,So come into work and not even get an 8 hour shift.,2,2.5,,,
1,1,,That kind of digs deep into you. So it's better for me to just sit at home.,5,5.4,,,
1,1,,You know because I have to like fix myself lunch or find my way here and pay a friend to take me or buy some gas. It just doesn't add up.,3,3.5,,,
1,1,Interviewer,So you talked about having to like call your friends to help you out with gas and things like that. Are there people in your community besides your immediate family like your neighbors who you can rely on? And if so what kind of help can you rely on them for?,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Well, I have this one friend to date. She's always there for anything. I'm not the type of person who just gonna ask just because I know you're going to give.",1,1.3,,,
1,1,,But sometimes I would like talk to her. She's the only one that would ever say: “Here's some gas when you are low you probably wouldn't ask me but you know here it is” or whatever.,1,1.3,,,
1,1,,But anything else I wouldn't ask. I just do with whatever we have.,3,3.6,,,
1,1,,"Because, I'm a Jamaican sometime if you have flour and you don't have meat you just you know pick it up put it in some grease and you get some fritters and you’re full.",3,"3.4,3.6",,,
1,1,Interviewer,I love fritters.,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"And oh my God, you're full.",0,0,,,
1,1,Interviewer,Yeah it's true.,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"You know, make do with what you have. So they're gonna have to give credit to my parents for the upbringing because they let you know, you know, be satisfied with what you have.",3,"3.4,3.5",,,
1,1,,Cause tomorrow you may never know.,0,0,,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Some people say that being financially stable means being able to pay your monthly expenses and also being able to save money for the future. Based on this definition, would you consider yourself financially stable?",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,No I'm not.,8,8.2,,,
1,1,Interviewer,"If not, what is one thing that's preventing you from becoming more financially secure?",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"I am not and what's preventing is having a well-paying job. Because if I– and when I have that job then I know I can manage, you know, my money so that I know that I can take care of whatever and still save some for later. You know so until then. I'm not.","2,8","2.2,8.2",,,
1,1,,And that's what I'm working towards.,0,0,,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Have you been able to get support through public programs, such as TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, or child care certificates? And if you’ve been able to get support, is it enough?",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Well yes I'm getting the child care services for my son and I'm getting SNAP. So both of them, yes they are enough. And they help a lot, a lot, a lot.",8,"8.4,8.3",,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Before this job training program, did you have a hard time finding a job? I know you spoke about this a little bit earlier but if you could elaborate. And if no, did the job pay enough to cover your expenses? But if yes, what were the reasons that you had difficulty finding a job or jobs?",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,Well I filled out 13 job applications before this program. And one job they sent me an email to do a questionnaire onsite and I did the questionnaire. But when you got to the part where are you a citizen that's where my block was. Cause I'm a permanent resident but not a citizen.,"2,3","2.3,3.5",,,
1,1,,But I still appreciate them because at least they replied. But I didn't hear from the rest of them. So I was jobless.,2,2.3,,,
1,1,,So I was jobless. Until this program.,2,2.3,,,
1,1,,"It was actually my roommate while I was in shelter. I heard talk about it just a little bit just walking by and it just stopped by ears. So I stopped, went back and I asked her. And she told me she had– I have to come to this interview or something like within a week. I'm like, “can I get the info.” And she sent me– she referred me to the site and I went on the got the info, called them ,and they book me on the same one.

1,1,Interviewer,My mom always says that to me.,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"I never, I never tried to take out a card from nowhere. Because if I don't have a good job. How am I going to pay for it?",8,8.1,,,
1,1,,I never went back to school or college because I'm not going to get no student loan.,"7,8","7.1,8.1",,,
1,1,,"How am I going to get– ‘cause I paid HHA [Home Health Assistance]. I tried for a CNA certification but when I got to the HHA part, you know what that means? Home health care.","2,7","2.1,7.1",,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Home Health Care, okay.",0,0,,,

1,1,Interviewer,"Right. Right. Okay so we're asking everyone this question and it may not apply, but has racism and or sexism in your opinion ever affected your ability to get a job?",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Racism, and this may come like a shocker because a lot of people expect it to be like a full blown thing here, for me, I've experienced it but not job wise. You know maybe just someone in the store or whatever but I've never really I'm not a victim of that here. And I'm grateful for that when it comes to getting a job or stuff like that.",3,"3.1,3.5",,,
1,1,Interviewer,What about sexism and experiences with–?,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,No.,0,0,,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Do you think, and this is kind of a side question, do you think that coming from Jamaica gave you a unique perspective on racism and sexism? Since you, for example my mom came to America and she was just kind of like, “what is like– what is this racism and what is the sexism? What are sort of the definitions of these terms?” Do you think that it gave you a unique perspective on these on these meanings?",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"I think what it does coming from Jamaica with us growing up among all the races. It makes us more– we're like, why people feel this way?",3,3.5,,,
1,1,Interviewer,Right.,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"I know all of us been through slavery. Theirs were worse than ours, they said, I wasn't here so I don't know. I read about it. Yes. But it kind of let us be a bit more mature. Like if you're going to throw what Michelle Obama said, when they hit low, you hit high.",3,3.5,,,
1,1,Interviewer,You hit high.,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"So we kind of, maybe ignore it or just brush it off, right. But I don't pay it no mind like that. I just kind of tell them that I'm really from Jamaica. So I don't see a color when I look at the person. I see a woman or I see a man. You know, and that's how I'm gonna refer to you. So it doesn't matter about your color.",3,3.5,,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Okay and what are your plans, do you have any plans after this job program or after graduating or leaving WinC?",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Oh yes. I already met with, oh now, it's a shame I don't even remember her exact title but this lady, her name is April.",0,0,,,
1,1,,"She worked at Ingalls [Shipbuilding]. That's where I tried to go. So I met with her at the salon because I braid hair, too, on the weekends.",2,2.1,,,
1,1,Interviewer,If I would've known that.,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,I know right.,0,0,,,
1,1,,"I met with her and we get to talking and stuff. So she asked me a little bit about the construction because she was over there and I was talking over here my friend. And we get to talking and she said, “I like your perspective, I like where you're going with this. So what if you don't get into Ingalls like right off the bat or whatever. What's your backup plan?” So I'm like “I'm going to walk up to any construction site, any local construction it doesn't matter. I just want to get my hands on some construction while my application is in process” and whatever. She's like, okay hold on. And she picked up her phone and she made a call. This gentleman actually worked at Ingalls for years. And is now working on her brother's house. So she got me a job with him.","1,2","1.3,2.3",,,
1,1,,"When I graduate from here, I'll be working with him.",2,2.1,,,
1,1,,"So I'm like “you don't have no idea how blessed you are. Bless this day I met you.” She was like, what. I said “you have no idea because I needed a job. I don't want to just graduate and go sit down and wait.” I like to work, you know so, I'm just grateful.",1,1.3,,,
1,1,Interviewer,"Wow, that's such a blessing.",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Yes, it is a blessing. Just keep coming.",0,0,,,
1,1,Interviewer,"And this is the perfect question to follow that. It seems that you are clearly on your path to realizing the hopes and dreams that you told me from at the beginning in terms of like you know having a big home and being able to bring your mom here and your kids, you have one big residence for all of your family. And I guess this will clearly be a great opportunity for you to continue towards that.",0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,Oh yes. Oh yes.,0,0,,,
1,1,,"And like I told the ladies, especially one of them I talked to all the time and I told her– I said, “listen if it's only one person gonna graduate from this school or this class, which all of us do, but if it's one person, that person gonna be me.”",5,5.4,,,
1,1,,Because they have rules and regulations and I grew up learning that whoever is set over you you've gotta respect them.,0,0,,,
1,1,,"And respect goes where it comes from. So it's heard and not given. So whatever they say, and even if I do something wrong ‘cause sometimes we have this teacher and she'll be like you can go home. Like if a phone rings in the closet, in the lockers or whatever and the person go to stop or it whatever, she says, “you can go. I'll see you tomorrow.” I'm like, if she ever told me one day, I'm going to be on my knees. I'm gonna be like, please don't send me home. So yeah, I'm on my path and I'm happy. Thanks to WinC again and again and again.",0,0,,,
1,1,,"And like I told the ladies, especially one of them I talked to all the time and I told her– I said, “listen if it's only one person gonna graduate from this school or this class, which all of us do, but if it's one person, that person gonna be me.”",0,0,1,,
1,1,Interviewer,Is there anything else that you would like. This is the end of the interview. Is there anything else that you'd like to say that I may not have addressed? Maybe sing us a song.,0,0,,,
1,1,Claudene,"Well not really because I think I said it all. But I know you're doing stuff about poverty, whatever ladies are going through and stuff like that. But, I think I can handle this now that I'm better at math now. And I've only gotten a teacher for 2 days. And I'm better at math and measures than I've been in all my life and I'm 45 about to be 46. And it's Sophia. She's an amazing teacher. ‘Cause she– if you don't understand something, she break it down so low, that you just get right up here with everybody else. And you know, I did a math test and I passed it the first time. I didn't have to do a second one. I'm like, yes!",0,0,,,
1,1,,"So I just want to say thanks to all the teachers and you know everyone that works here. The staff, they're amazing family. I love them. And I appreciate everything. And you, I'm glad you were the one who interviewed me too. I would be grateful for anyone but to meet a fellow Jamaican ‘cause your mom is Jamaica, you're a Jamaican.",1,1.3,,,
2,1,Interviewer,Could you please just tell me a little bit about yourself? Maybe say your name again and your background.,0,0,,,
2,1,Kandy,My name is Kandy Nickles. 41. I'm Hispanic. I'm originally born and raised in California and I moved out to Texas.,0,0,,,
2,1,,"I went to school, studied in school in San Marcus and then to start building my foundation, I moved to Houston and started working.",7,7.1,,,
2,1,,I lived out there for the last 14 years and then I had a little girl in 2011 and I was with her father then.,1,"1.2,1.4",,,
2,1,,I had my own business. I was– I do a house cleaning business and residential and a whole lot.,2,2.1,,,
2,1,,I went to medical school in billing and coding and graduated. I went to a trade school and got business and office and then took a semester criminal justice and this school that I was going through paid for the semester at the University and Texas so I'm kind of a little bit certified in a little bit in everything.,"2,7","2.1,7.1",,,
2,1,,Growing up my dad's a general contractor so he did concrete and fencing and building. My mom she’s always been a full-time mom of seven. I'm number four so I got three older sisters and two younger brothers and a sister.,0,0,,,
2,1,,"But thankfully we were not in, how I guess you would say, poverty.",3,3.6,,,
2,1,,"My dad had his own business and my mom did all the accounting and took care of all the paperwork. So we were okay. Then we made them move my fourth grade year back to California. We were living in Texas, made it back to California, and then I ended up, when we moved back to– I was born in California then we moved to Texas when I was a little girl and then I was in Texas all the way up until my 4th grade year, then my parents, we packed up and moved back to California and I stayed there ‘till I turned 18, just about.",0,0,,,
2,1,,"Then I went off to school and to a dorm. First day that I turned– on my 18th birthday was my first day at the school. I was sitting and we were in a big old class first day orientation and I was nervous because I'd never been away from home. I never was– I was sheltered you know and so it was new to me. And then I sat there for two years two and a half years and I got a lot of experience, that's when I was able to take a semester of criminal justice because I got into the legal field and I wanted to be an FBI agent. That was always my thing. Federal investigations services but then when I, I did get into it it was totally not what I thought. Not like TV. So I ended up taking office in business technology learning computers and whatnot.",7,7.1,,,
2,1,,"So with that I ran and graduated and stuff and then I moved to Houston that's where I worked for some private investigators for a while and then I did a little bit of that litigation, files and dealing with attorneys and everything and then I stopped working and then I got into sales, cars sales, and there was a lot of money and just. A lump sum of money. And at the time instead of doing hourly by the by the hour or you know. And then eventually I ended up getting my own business. I had my own business for like, probably like nine years.",2,2.1,,,
2,1,Interviewer,Your own business in car sales?,0,0,,,
2,1,Kandy,Not in car sales.,,,,,
2,1,,I left the car sales and I started my own business in residential and cleaning and stuff sometimes. So I made my money like that.,2,2.1,,,
2,1,,"So that's what I was over the last nine years and then having, just, my little girl got older I was with her dad and then my relationship started getting rocky, he started to get abusive and I never had been involved or dealt with none of that. I was already 34 years old, girl, when I got pregnant and had my first child. So I was like I had to get out.","1,3","1.1,3.2",,,
2,1,,"This is not the way. I wasn't raised like this so I'm not going to raise her growing up and letting her think that that's okay, that that's a way of life. So I got up and left when she was 3. Cause at 3 you know you remember all the way back until you're 3 so I didn't want her to have that memory of us you know. So I left and that was the best thing I could have did.",4,4.1,,,
2,1,,"But it was the hardest thing in my life because I've never, I never knew what it was to have a child by myself, like a child at all because I've never had any kids until I was in my 30s but to be a single parent mom, it was just like, there are so– I closed up everything, wrapped up everything and was making my move back to California with my family and I met my fiancé on my way out and I took off to California, he came to Mississippi and my first time coming out here to visit him was in March 27th. I said Imma go visit him and see what Mississippi's about and if he don't propose to me I'm gonna just call it off because I don't want a long distant relationship.",1,1.1,,,
2,1,,"You know my daughter and everything she's getting ready to start kindergarten and I'm giving her– I don't want to work, I don't want to. Not her first year of school. I want to devote all my time to her cause it's up to me that's the most important. And so that's what I did.",4,"4.1,4.2",,,
2,1,,"I came out here and I got here on Friday and then Saturday night, we were at the casino, both of us. And then he was acting so nervous and moving around I was just like, I said, “oh Jesus go over there ‘cause you keep going back. You're like pacing back and forth” and then he's just like “I didn't know that.” He was trying to figure out how it was funny. So that eventually he was like, ""are you hungry, you want to go get something?"" I said, ""yeah I think we can."" And then he pops the question on me and I was just like– oh I was like ""Yes!"" I said, ""Oh my God I love the ring."" And then he was just like so is that a yes? And I'm like, ""yes, yes!""",1,1.1,,,
2,1,,"So then I wrapped up everything and flew back Sunday and then I was like well I guess I'm moving to Mississippi. So that's why, how I came out here but he gave me that year with my daughter– she's just got in first grade.","3,4","3.3,4.2",,,
2,1,,"And so now it's to get into the work field, but all those degrees and stuff that I have? Certificates, certification. It does not help me whatsoever here in Mississippi.",7,7.2,,,
2,1,,"I didn't know how many years or how long back it was that I had heard $7.25 minimum wage, you know? Everything else is way– it's already like $9 and $8. Close to 9 I think is the lowest I've heard. And when I got here they said minimum wage was $7 I was like, oh my god.",,,,,
2,1,,"Like in the medical field, there's no way I could support my daughter and myself if I was to break off on my, you know what I mean, and try and do it on my own.",,,,,
2,1,,"I'm on state assistance, I went in there and I've never been in all my life. I never had a state assistant and I went in there not for a handout. I went for, I went in there for a hand up, like, ""help me.""",,,,,
2,1,,I said in all these years only one time I used assistance and that was when I was pregnant with my daughter and they gave me Medicaid in Texas but never did I have to use food stamps or the money or anything.,,,,,
2,1,,"And so when I came here, I had no vehicle to move. I flew out here and just moved in. I had no vehicle, I had nothing and they didn't want to give me no cash.",,,,,
2,1,,Where I live here in Mississippi is in Van Cleave. It's a little town and they don't have nothing there like the nearest Walmart's 30 miles or I should say like 15 but we're on the outskirts of the little town so it takes probably extra 10 so it's about like 25 miles one way.,,,,,
2,1,,So it was just like– even to get a job away from there I would just spend the money on gas and try to find somewhere to pay because I had to pay for child care and my– I had only worked part time because I don't know nobody you know that a of work full time,,,,,
3,1,Interviewer,Tell me a little bit about yourself.,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,Well my name is Krista Augustine. I'm originally from Louisiana. I'm the baby girl of six siblings.,0,0,,,
3,1,,I have twin girls: seven and my little boy is six and I actually moved here from Louisiana to Mississippi to a bigger and better place for bigger and better opportunities because growing up for me it wasn't rough but it wasn't a life that I'll be happy to have.,"1,3","1.4,3.3",,,
3,1,,I'm just trying to do bigger and better things for me and my kids because everything I'm doing is mainly for my kids. You know because they actually see me daily doing everything I do.,4,4.2,,,
3,1,,"You know that's mainly why and this program is helping me in becoming a better person, knowing more and learning more and it's just teach me a whole lot. I'm actually happy to be here. It wasn't too too hard for me but I'm getting better now.",7,7.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,"So you mentioned that you want to do ""bigger and better things,” what are some of those things?",0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,Well I'm going to be my own boss with this situation that by being in Women in Construction hopefully one day I'll have my own team. Maybe we could fix a washing machine for somebody. We can do anything I'm learning now.,2,2.1,,,
3,1,,"So just a bigger, a better job, making more money instead of me...right now, I'm housekeeping and I've never done housekeeping in my life but there's nothing wrong with it because I'm getting paid for it. I just want to make money to be able to not just pay my bills but to be able to live and be happy with living.",2,"2.1,2.2",,,
3,1,,So I just want to make sure me and my kids are able to live and just work for...get a bigger house and just not work for...pay bills. I don't want just work to pay bills. I want to be able to work and live and be happy.,8,8.2,,,
3,1,,"My bills are paid and be able to go explore. Take vacations. This is like my first place, first time being out of Louisiana. I never been to nowhere besides Mississippi.",0,0,,,
3,1,Interviewer,You mentioned that you are a housekeeper now right?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,Yes ma'am.,0,0,,,
3,1,Interviewer,So what were your past work experiences like?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,PCA. I've been doing PCA.,2,2.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,Can you explain what PCA is?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"It's a caregiver. It's like a CNA but it's not...I'm not certified just yet. So I went to Camelot College in 2010 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and I was getting my medical assistance. So now I'm PCA. I've been doing PCA for 2011 until I moved here and I just loved it. I love taking care of elderlies, disabled. I love being able to say I'm able to help someone. It makes me feel good inside.",2,2.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,"What inspires you to want to do that? Like, yeah to become a PCA? Also what did you study in college while you were there? ",0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,Medical Assistance.,7,7.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,Medical Assistance.,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"Yes ma’am. And helping with PCA...I love to be able to help the elderly. Exercise, I exercise with them. They teach me, I teach them. I help them, they help me. And being able to know that I’m helping someone that need help, it makes me feel good inside. It makes really feel good inside to know that I can help the disabled to the young, not only disabled, the young. I done help a lot of different people.","2,5","2.1,5.4",,,
3,1,,"And just thinking about it..I actually continue on to do it but it's like a pay...they... I don't do it right now because they weren't paying for mileage. That was kind of hard for me getting back and forth to my client's house and I don't want to let them down because my car won't let me get to my client's house doesn't mean they don't need me. So, I just let it go for right now.",6,6.3,,,
3,1,,"So, I just let it go for right now.",0,0,,,
3,1,,That's why I'm doing housekeeping.,2,2.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,So in the past were you paying for your own gas to get to the...?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,Yes ma'am.,0,0,,,
3,1,Interviewer,So the place you were working for was it a company or was it like–,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,It's a company.,0,0,,,
3,1,,It was called “All About You Health Care.” It was a company.,0,0,,,
3,1,Interviewer,And what was it like working for the company?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,Loved it.,0,0,,,
3,1,,"It was like. You know, we all...my manager, my supervisor she'd make you feel like a sister. You know you can come to her anytime. It's really like... It was really like home, my job. And I hated to leave it but I had to do what's right to live for me and my babies.",1,1.3,,,
3,1,,And I hated to leave it but I had to do what's right to live for me and my babies.,4,4.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,So you mentioned that you were originally from Louisiana.,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,Yes ma'am.,0,0,,,
3,1,Interviewer,"So just tell me a little bit more about your family, what it was like growing up there and stuff like that?",0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,In Louisiana. I'm the baby of course and I'm the baby of five sisters and one brother. So growing up there...my mom she's been PCA. She's done that for over 20 years so that's where I picked that up from.,0,0,,,
3,1,,"And she's also housekeeping for like 10 years. My dad is at working in Angola State Penitentiary. He'd been there for 43 years so he and my mom been separated for over 20 years, but there's still a marriage. And my mom, she sacrificed a lot for us. My dad is the one that make us ....He’s right from wrong. He's stuck on righteousness, you know because he figures that we know what's right from wrong. But my mom, she's still to this point that she's there for her kids. You know right is wrong...right is right and wrong is wrong but she's there.",0,0,,,
3,1,,"So despite that all of us is grown, she tries her best to make sure that we are able to be happy and have what we want for our kids and provide. She still provides for us when we can't provide for ourselves.",1,1.2,,,
3,1,,"So, it's kind of better for me now, I can say and I'm getting...I'm molding myself to be a better person. And I love it. I love the person I'm becoming right now. Because my mom saying “you're dedicated to be someone hon.” I said ""Yes ma'am. I'm definitely going to be someone.”",5,5.4,,,
3,1,,"And with this program here, these ladies here, it's definitely helping me out a whole lot because it's been hard for me. But with prayer and constantly thinking about with God everything is possible. And that's how I go about every day. I do go about that every day. So I keep myself motivated a whole lot. I'm self-motivated a whole, whole lot.",5,5.4,,,
3,1,Interviewer,Right. So do you think like maybe say five years ago you could have imagined yourself where you are?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"No I couldn't. I always say that I would not know where I would be 5 years ago. I'm thankful that I'm here now because five years ago, I probably would have been in rougher situations, a bad situation, but I'm thankful to be here. I'm not in a good, good situation right now but I'm better than what I was 5 years ago. I am. I definitely am. Of course I have my babies now with me and they're grown so we're definitely in a better place now. Yes.",0,0,,,
3,1,Interviewer,So you did mention that you're the youngest in your family right?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,Yes I am. Yes ma'am.,0,0,,,
3,1,Interviewer,I kind of just would like to know more about what your community was like. I know what your family was like but what was your community like,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"My community is like, we're very small it's like. Maybe where I'm from, we have maybe 2000 people from and most of those people is my family and it's very...it's a small...it's called Simmesport. I use Marksville because that’s like the bigger part of where I'm from but Simmesport, Louisiana is where I'm originally from and it’s a very, very, very small county. There is no place...it's nothing to do there. Like, there is no Wal-Mart. You have to go drive 20 minutes to go to Wal-mart. There's no McDonalds. I don't know, it's like maybe three, four convenience stores in rows. It's dirt roads. So that's where I'm from. That's where exactly where I am from.",0,0,,,
3,1,Interviewer,Can you tell me more about like what the schools were like?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"My school, I went too...When I moved from Simmesport, Louisiana, it was first great, so I went to Ferriday Junior High. Ferriday it was...is a rough little town to be in. It's like mainly killing. So school was kind of rough on me and I didn't finish school because of where I was growing up at. So if I probably would have been in a different community or something, I probably would have finished school but it backtracked me a lot because of my community.",7,7.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,What do you feel like were some of the obstacles that you faced in terms of not being able to finish school? And by that you mean high school or you mean–,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,High school.,7,7.1,,,
3,1,,"I made it to 11th grade and I didn't complete high school. Maybe if my mom would have been a little strict on me, I could say say she wasn't...about me being a baby, she wasn't really strict on me because she believed in not having her kids have a hard life because of what she went through.",7,7.1,,,
3,1,,"You're meaning like– can you explain to me more, like your question?",0,0,,,
3,1,Interviewer,So I mean like what were some of the issues that you faced in not being able to graduate and not being able to finish. Like what were some of the challenges?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"The reason I didn’t finish school was because in 11th grade I got golds [gold tooth cap]. My principal sent me to alternative school and there was like obstacles. I was dancing and I was in band, I was cymbal-playing. So when she sent me to alternative school, it kind of flunked me, you know.",7,7.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,What was the name of the school?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,Ferriday High School. Ferriday High School.,7,7.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,You said she sent you to another school?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"Alternative school. It's like a bad school because I had golds"". I was in 11th grade. And she was the principal who made her own rules up.",7,7.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,Why did she send you there?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"She made her own rules up. I guess because I was really like the first person with golds and I didn't think that there would've been a problem because I'm a junior. I'm in 11th grade. But she did send me to alternative school and the alternative school is like for bad people and I'm not nearby a bad person. So it kind of, I just stopped going there and I went to... I started going to Camelot College and I started going to medical assistance. I didn't have a highschool diploma or a GED. I was picking my GED up as well going to Camelot College. It was a 10 month program. Medical Assistance.",7,7.1,,,
3,1,,"So after that I got pregnant with my twins and from there I just would start living life without trying to...I want to further my education and that's why I'm here. My mom, she did try too.",0,0,,,
3,1,,"But it was just different obstacles. Like the community sometimes, sometimes the community can hold you back from a lot. You have to have this wrong mentality and then my sisters– they're not really like a big sister to me. You know, I'm like a big sister to them. So, it was kind of rough for me to know what was the really right thing that I want to do because now they see what kind of person that I am and they see that I want...and they wasn't really there to be like ""well this is my little sister. We can help with her this and help with that.” They was always calling me for the help so.",1,1.2,,,
3,1,Interviewer,What would you wish that your sisters had done then?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"I wish there was... I wish they would have been there for me the time that I needed instead of judging me you know. My family, they are not judge-able but they judge you more than they'll help you. I wish they'd be like, call me when I need or just call me and check on me. To this day, I still don't get a phone call to just get checked on but..it's okay.",1,1.2,,,
3,1,Interviewer,You mentioned earlier that your principal sent you to an alternative school. And my question is sort of like what was her reasoning for sending you there?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"I got the gold teeth. So that school was to be honest, Ferriday High School was a very crooked school and now she got so many complaints that they fired her from being a principal. She went through a lot of different situations and wound up getting sick after all that she... she's stopped like 30 of us from graduating. So she's the reason a lot of us didn't graduate in that little small town.",7,7.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,And did anyone ever try and take her out?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"Yes. We've fought. It's a lot of parents who actually fought until they got her out of there. And now she's fighting cancer now. Bless her heart. But she really...I don't fault her but I figured if she wouldn't have done the things that she'd done, just for living, I would have graduated. I'm in 11th grade. You send me to alternative school. I'm not a bad person. I've never done nothing bad in my life so why I have to go to alternative school because I have gold teeth?",0,0,,,

3,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. I noticed that you keep using the word ""bad person.” I'm just curious to know who else went to the alternative school.",0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"Alternative school is for people who are fighting, being disrespectful to teachers, bringing guns to school, illegal things to school. That's for alternative school. Alternative school you just don't send people there just for un-reasons of that kind. ",3,3.6,,,https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/racialjustice/missingthemark_report.pdf#page=15
3,1,,So by sending me to alternative school just for...she didn't send me there for 30 days because of...she said it was in a handbook. But I didn't think that would stop me from going to school.,0,0,,,
3,1,Interviewer,So was the alternative school nearby?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,Yes ma'am. It was still in Ferriday. ,0,0,,,
3,1,,"But that school was very, very harsh. It was very hard to go there. It was very hard to finish there because of course you're surrounded by some of the kids that don't care about school. So it's not... it's taking some of your focus and you don't want to surrounded by some of those people.",1,1.3,,,
3,1,,"So yeah of course, when you don't have the right person to tell you to just go through it and of course my sisters and my mom they weren't there to tell me: “Well just finish it, just go through, you almost there.” So they was like “well don’t worry about it.” They was more of ""Well don’t worry about it. If this is how you feel, don't worry about it.”",1,1.2,,,
3,1,,So that's why I stopped going to school and just proceeded with college. But that wasn't enough for me as well.,7,7.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,What was your college experience like?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"I loved it. I loved to be able to go to college and that's why college...that's what I really, really want. You know, a certificate behind my name or something behind my name. You know, going to college was a very great experience for me. Very, very great experience. It was an all-girls college. The guys can only come to school but they cannot stay. The campus was only for girls.",7,7.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,It's kind of like my school. We're an all-girls school.,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"We had a pastor for our principal. We had a church on our campus as well. So it really helped us get us a whole, whole lot. It kept us focused and when I did finish the class and I got my medical assistance, my pregnancy came and I didn't know I was pregnant.",0,0,,,
3,1,,"So when I went back home, I wind up not going to proceed with my medical assistance so I just started doing PCA which I still love until this day. I just love taking care of other people.",2,2.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,I know you talked a lot about being a PCA and know you're in the Women in Construction program but I'm just curious...,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"Women in Construction is, I'm going to be honest, it’s very new to me. I'm loving it. I love it. This year, I never thought about women in construction from where I'm from. I never thought women can do construction. So it's very new to me.",3,3.5,,,
3,1,,"My kids, I come home every day, they see how excited– I'm very excited.",0,0,,,
3,1,,"So Women in Construction is something..that's going to be a career. You know PCA, I love it because I love to be able to help others when needed. But I'm still able to help others when needed when I'm in Women in Construction so I'm definitely going to take this. This is going to be the career for me. This is definitely going to be the career for me.",2,2.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer,"I know you said that, like about your medical assistance, do you think you're ever going to want to use that or you're set on Women in Construction? ",0,,,,
3,1,Krista,"No, I'm set. Yes ma'am. I'm really kind of set here now because this is very exciting.",0,0,,,
3,1,,"It's very new and of course I didn't think that I can do Women in Construction. So I'm going to take this here and I'm going to show the world that we can do it. I believe it's nothing that we can't do. This shows us a lot that women can do just as more as men can do, and I'm going to take Women in Construction and run with it. Yeah. That's why I'm focused now in this class.","3,5","3.5, 5.4",,,
3,1,,"I thank these ladies so, so, so much because they're molding us to be…they're really molding us to... it's just a program but with this job program they teach us so much. There's so much they give us.",0,0,,,
3,1,,"So yeah definitely, when I graduate here, I'm going to definitely proceed and hopefully I have a job waiting on me but then I'm going to concentrate on working for myself. If it's going out to people's house fixing anything or building benches. I'm going to build my momma a bench (inaudible). But it's going to, yeah Women in Construction is going to be my career. Medical assistance, it may be something I may part-time do again but I don't think I will. I don’t think I will.",2,2.1,,,
3,1,Interviewer ,What do you want for your children in the future?,0,0,,,
3,1,Krista,"I want my kids to be able to not look for handouts. I want them to be able to know there is a way you can get it. You don't have to sit around and wait on anyone. You see, that's why I work so hard so they can see that I'm working hard...I'm not waiting around to get handouts. I let them see that I stress at times, because I do. ",4,4.1,,,
3,1,,"So I'm letting them know, my daughters always said... ""Mom I want to be like you.” So when I hear them say that, I be like I know you watching me. So I'm going to continue molding myself to be greater and greater so whatever I do is...what I'm doing, you can do it as well. So I make sure I do the right thing because I know my kids are watching me. ","4,5","4.1,5.4",,,
3,1,,"I do want them to grow up as being the greatest they can be, sticking together. I don't want them to leave each other of course. Especially my twins, I don't want them to leave each other. I want them to work. I want them to always be independent. I want them to help each other when needed and I want them to feel...I don't never want them to not communicate with each other. Never. I want them to always stick together. I don't care if they're 50 million miles away. I want them to always call each other and check on each other. Definitely. Help each other out. Have a dream. I want them to have a dream and right now that's what we focus on. I know they're still young. They're very very young but I want them to know that ""what all do y'all want to do,"" you know, ""what do you want to do? And whatever you want to do, you definitely can do it.
